This repository was created in order to allow users to report issues, ideas, requests and see their status.

Also, if you want to create localization (translate Ariela to your language), please use the strings.xml (english) version, translate it to your language and send it to me to be included into Ariela. Thank you.

For sending Ariela logs please follow instructions from : http://ariela.surodev.com/2019/01/06/debug-mode/
